# final-project

This project includes creating a focus dashboard for users to have a minimalist-style
webpage that reduces distraction during worktime to increase productivity. The page 
includes a timer feature, a to-do list feature and a insert-playlist feature that plays
youtube playlists. With each new video, a new color scheme that relates to the thumbnail
of the current video will decorate the webpage.

With most popular productivity hack features being available on the site, and providing
a distraction free environment for the users, this webpage will help in increasing 
productivity.
