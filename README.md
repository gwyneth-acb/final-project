# Focus Dashboard (hcde 310 final project)

This project includes creating a focus dashboard for users to have a minimalist-style webpage that reduces distraction during worktime to increase productivity. Includes a timer feature, a to-do list feature and a insert-playlist feature that plays youtube playlists. With each new video, a new color scheme that relates to the thumbnail of the current video will decorate the webpage.
